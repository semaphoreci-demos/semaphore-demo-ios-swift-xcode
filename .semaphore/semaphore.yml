# Name your pipeline. If you choose to connect multiple pipelines with
# promotions, the pipeline name will help you differentiate between

# The agent defines the environment in which your CI runs. It is a combination
# of a machine type and an operating system image. For a project built with
# Xcode you must use one of the Apple machine types, coupled with a macOS image
# running either Xcode 11 or Xcode 12.
# See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types
